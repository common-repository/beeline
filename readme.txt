= What language does Beeline support? =

We currently analyze English texts only.

= Why do I see Beeline bees on some of my posts, but none on others? =

Beeline was designed to provide accurate and to the point information. We believe in providing additional information to your readers
where it matters most. On some blog posts (such as personal diaries) the ideas and topics found by Beeline are highly specific and no
truly relevant information can be found. In such cases we prefer to show no bees rather than spam your readers.

= Any other issue? =
